Bug Fix
    after adding a Daily WOD you couldn't edit immediate without reloading it to edit.
        awo.ID = string(insertid)
            string(integer) - Conversion from int64 to string interprets an integer value as a code point
            this was sending a { to the page and breaking the update statement
        awo.ID = strconv.FormatInt(insertid, 10)
            Properly converts the integer to a string
