Welcome to the worst README.md. I'm working on it ..

goodadvice is a fitness tracking app.

UX is still at MVP level cause I hate UX design



Admins can create daily workouts that are accessible to users and guests.
Those workouts are editable by admins as well.
Users can leave notes about the workout and go back and review them later.
Guests can only view the daily workout.

    COMPLETED - Created a Single table for this 
                    loved and hated check boxes work and store value to user_workout_rating table
    Usage (future features)
        Loved or hated workouts get extra chances to show up in random workout assignments
        These DON'T turn on the checkboxes on the workout page 
            This enables the athlete to boost their love to hate for a workout
        They can also be seen by coaches to throw happy or sad workout at client
        User can review loved or hated in profile
            Sorted by most hated or like
Test/benchmark admin ratings for workouts on Edit workout Page

Validate the input before saving, make sure it's a time stamp

better error handling:
I get kicked out each time it errs,
Cleaning text data before running SQL,
Validate a date on entered workout when saving and give option to fix.
